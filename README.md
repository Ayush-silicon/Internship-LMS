# Internship-LMS
This project demonstrates my ability to build secure, scalable enterprise applications using RBAC, while ensuring code quality and reliability through Test-Driven Development.

## About The Project ...
Real-world system design – An LMS mirrors enterprise applications used in companies and institutions

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) – You understand security, authorization, and access policies, which is critical in production systems

TDD (Test-Driven Development) – You follow professional development practices, writing tests before code

Quality & reliability focus – Emphasis on maintainable, bug-resistant, and scalable code

User & admin separation – Shows clarity in handling multiple user roles and permissions

## 🔐 Security Checklist
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use environment variables for all secrets
- ✅ Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` secure (server-side only)
- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
